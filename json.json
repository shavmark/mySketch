          { "p": "The Chairman. Today's hearing addresses S.J. Res. 15, a joint resolution to acknowledge the contributions of Native Americans to this country but also the long history of official depredations and ill-conceived policies by the U.S. Government regarding Indians."},
          { "p": "The resolution apologizes to Native Peoples on behalf of the United States. I commend Senator Brownback for introducing the measure and I look forward to his testimony. I note that he introduced an apology resolution in the last Congress. That resolution, passed by unanimous consent of this committee with an amendment in the nature of a substitute, was never acted on by the full Senate."},
          { "p": "S.J. Res. 15 apologizes for the several hundred years of wrongs the Federal Government has perpetrated against Native Americans. Reviewing the history of this Government's treatment of Native peoples makes painfully obvious that the Government has repeatedly broken its promises and caused great harm to the Nation's original inhabitants." },
		  { "p": " While remembering our past wrongs is important, it is also important that we answer those wrongs with vigorous actions and policies that actively promote the well-being of Native Americans today."}
